I created a directory structure (project and logs) and files using mkdir and touch. I learned to move files using mv and wildcards (*.log), and practiced access control: I used chmod to set files to "read-only" mode and others to be "executable" only for the user. Finally, I deleted files with rm.
I created sample files with content using nano and organized them in a folder named data. Then, I used grep to perform advanced searches: I found lines containing the word "ERROR," searched for the word "user" regardless of case (case-insensitive), and counted how many times the word "admin" appeared. Finally, I learned to use sort and its options to order a file's content and display only the unique lines.
