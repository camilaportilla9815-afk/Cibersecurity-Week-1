Exercise 1 - Network-Commands:The network command procedure began by using ip a to identify the interface configuration, establishing the local IP as 192.198.8.113 on the eth0 interface. Subsequently, ip route was employed to determine the gateway (192.168.8.1). Then, the commands netstat -tuln and ss -tuln were used to list listening connections and ports, observing the active services. The connectivity phase included using ping to test the connection with both the router and the local VM, followed by testing the connection to a specific port using nc -zv IP(local) <port>. Finally, the exercise concluded with the use of ss -t to exclusively list the active TCP connections on the virtual machine.
